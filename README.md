# Library-Service
My very first Python project. (In french) 

The aim of this project was to simulate a library service in Python. 
In this simulation we had to be able to registre userq (reader) with theirs data (pseudo, age, gender, reading preferences,...) and list the books users have read.
Then the program should calculate a similarity matrice to find users with similarities and recommand books that one user read to the other users which are similar but don't read the books.
